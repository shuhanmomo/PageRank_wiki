    Computes the steady-state distribution by simulating running the Markov
    chain. Collects samples at regular intervals and returns the empirical
    distribution of the samples.

    Inputs
    ------
    conditional_distribution : A dictionary in which each key is an state,
                               and each value is a Distribution over other
                               states.

    N_samples : the desired number of samples for the approximate empirical
                distribution

    iterations_between_samples : how many jumps to perform between each collected
                                 sample

    -------
    An empirical Distribution over the states that should approximate the
    steady-state distribution.
